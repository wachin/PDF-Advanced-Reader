# PDFAR — Advanced PDF Reader for Linux
## Mission: Build a benchmark PDF reader for Linux

You are working on an existing project called:

PDFAR — Advanced PDF Reader for Linux

The long-term goal is to transform PDFAR into a professional-grade PDF reader for Linux: fast, stable, modern, accessible, secure, privacy-conscious, highly configurable, and capable of functionally competing with the most comprehensive PDF readers available on Linux.

You must NOT treat this as a new project.

You must preserve existing functionality and evolve the architecture incrementally.

The absolute priorities are:

1. Do not break existing functionality.
2. Do not introduce performance regressions.
3. Keep the interface responsive.
4. Maintain security and stability when handling malformed or massive PDFs.
5. Maintain a maintainable architecture.
6. Add features via well-defined modules.
7. Every new feature must have verifiable tests.

---

# 1. CURRENT STATE — PDFAR 2.0

Before modifying anything:

- Inspect the entire repository.
- Read the README, documentation, tests, and source code.
- Run the existing test suite.
- Verify that the initial state works correctly.
- Do not assume a feature exists simply because it is mentioned in the documentation.
- Always verify the code's actual behavior. The current reference version is:

PDFAR 2.0.0

Main stack:

- Python >= 3.9
- PyQt6
- PyMuPDF
- pytest
- Qt Linguist for translations
- GPL-3.0-or-later

The current structure includes:

src/pdfar/
main.py
viewer.py
render.py
cache.py
geometry.py
search.py
sidebar.py
i18n.py

Additionally:

- tests/
- tools/
- translations/
- run.py
- pyproject.toml
- Debian documentation

The current architecture already features:

- asynchronous rendering
- priority-based render queue
- independent workers
- one PyMuPDF document per worker
- memory-limited LRU cache
- continuous scrolling
- actual text selection
- text copying
- AND search
- OR search
- phrase search
- case sensitivity
- whole-word matching
- result highlighting
- F3 / Shift+F3 navigation
- thumbnails
- index/outline
- zoom
- fit page
- fit width
- rotation
- password-protected PDFs
- recent files
- drag & drop
- window state persistence
- Qt Linguist-based internationalization
- headless tests
- screenshot tool
- initial documentation for Debian packaging

Do not re-implement these features from scratch.

First, reuse and extend the existing architecture.

---

# 2. GOLDEN RULES — NON-NEGOTIABLE RULES

These rules are mandatory.

## 2.1 GUI and threads

NEVER:

- use QPixmap from a worker thread;
- modify Qt widgets from a worker thread;
- use QTimer.singleShot() from a worker thread expecting it to execute GUI code;
- directly access GUI objects from worker threads; - sharing the same `fitz.Document` across different threads.

Worker-to-GUI communication must be handled via properly connected Qt signals.

Render results should reach the GUI as safe data, such as:

- PNG bytes
- serializable data
- simple Python structures

Conversion to `QImage`/`QPixmap` must take place in the GUI thread.

---

## 2.2 PyMuPDF

Rule:

ONE FITZ DOCUMENT PER THREAD.

Any worker needing to work with a PDF must open its own:

`fitz.Document`

Never share the main `Document` object among workers.

The document used by the GUI and the documents used by workers must have independent lifecycles.

Always close documents properly.

---

## 2.3 Overlays

Overlays must never be permanently drawn onto the cached bitmap.

This includes:

- search results
- selections
- temporary annotations
- text selection
- page indicators
- other dynamic elements

The cached bitmap represents the page's base content.

Overlays are drawn during the `paintEvent` or via a separate layer.

This prevents highlights from accumulating every time a page is repainted.

---

## 2.4 Qt Signals

Avoid unnecessary lambdas connected to Qt signals if they could cause lifetime/GC issues or complicate teardown.

Prefer:

- bound methods
- explicit `QObject`s
- dedicated signals
- clearly defined slots

Every connection must have a clear lifecycle.

---

## 2.5 Shutdown

Pools and workers must be shut down correctly.

Where applicable:

shutdown(wait=True)

Do not allow a worker to keep running while the QObject destined to receive its signal is being destroyed.

The shutdown of:

- RenderPool
- SearchWorker
- QThread
- PyMuPDF documents

must be deterministic.

---

## 2.6 Geometry

All coordinate transformations must remain centralized.

Do not duplicate calculations for:

- rotation
- PDF coordinates
- screen coordinates
- zoom
- rectangles
- selection
- annotations

Use a common geometry layer.

Any new functionality that draws on a page must use that same transformation.

This is especially important for:

- annotations
- selection
- search
- redaction
- measurements
- forms
- signatures

---

# 3. ARCHITECTURAL PRINCIPLE

PDFAR must evolve towards a modular architecture.

Do not turn main.py or viewer.py into massive files.

When a feature reaches sufficient complexity, create an independent module.

Future examples:

annotations.py
bookmarks.py
tabs.py
forms.py
signatures.py
attachments.py
metadata.py
page_operations.py
accessibility.py
redaction.py
ocr.py
preferences.py
document_compare.py

The graphical interface should coordinate functionalities.

PDF logic should be kept separate from visual logic whenever possible.

Logic that does not require Qt should preferably be:

- pure
- testable
- GUI-independent

---

# 4. DEFINITION OF DONE

No task is finished simply because it "works."

A task is only DONE when:

1. The functionality is implemented.
2. Existing tests continue to pass.
3. New tests are added where applicable. 4. Tests are executed at least 3 times consecutively.
4. There are no known crashes.
5. There are no new critical warnings.
6. Visual verification is performed when the task affects the GUI.
7. `tools/screenshot.py` is used where applicable.
8. Behavior is checked with both small and large PDFs.
9. There is no performance regression exceeding 15% relative to the baseline.
10. Any introduced technical debt is documented.
11. Documentation is updated where applicable.

For GUI features:

- functional test
- headless test
- screenshot
- visual review

For PDF features:

- valid PDF
- large PDF
- PDF with special features (where applicable)
- protected PDF (where applicable)

---

# 5. PERFORMANCE BASELINE

Record a baseline before making significant changes.

As an initial reference, PDFAR 2.0 documents approximately:

- opening a 200-page document: ~0.31 s
- first page rendered: ~0.22 s
- jump to page 200 + render: ~0.13 s
- zoom 100% → 300% + render: ~0.5 s

These values ​​serve as a reference, not a universal guarantee.

Create or improve a reproducible benchmarking system.

Every significant modification must compare:

baseline vs. new version.

Rule:

Do not accept a regression >15% unless there is an explicit, documented technical reason.

---

# 6. PDFAR VS. PROFESSIONAL FEATURES

Do not blindly copy other readers.

Use a functional comparison matrix to identify gaps.

| Area | PDFAR 2.0 | Future Goal | Status |

This table serves as a coverage guide, not a list for simultaneous implementation.

---

# 7. OFFICIAL ROADMAP

Implement features in phases.

Do not skip arbitrarily from one phase to another unless there is a technical reason.

---

# P1 — READING EXPERIENCE

Objective:

Transform PDFAR into a modern reading experience.

## P1-1 Tabs

Implement support for multiple open documents.

Requirements:

- tabs
- close tab
- open PDF in new tab
- switch tab
- independent state per document
- independent zoom
- independent current page
- independent search
- independent selection
- independent annotations
- proper RenderPool closure per document

Acceptance criteria:

- open 3 PDFs simultaneously
- switch between them without corruption
- close any of them
- no active workers remain
- memory usage does not increase indefinitely

## P1-2 Presentation mode

- fullscreen
- hide UI
- keyboard navigation
- next/previous page
- ESC to exit

## P1-3 Dark mode

Do not limit changes to just the background.

Must cover:

- toolbar
- sidebar
- search panel
- menus
- dialogs
- selection
- indicators
- areas outside the document pages

## P1-4 Resume reading

Save per file:

- page
- zoom
- rotation
- fit mode
- scroll position
- tab/document state where applicable

## P1-5 Reflow

Investigate the actual limitations of the PDF format.

Do not pretend that all PDFs can reflow perfectly.

There must be a warning or fallback for PDFs where this is not possible. ---

# P2 — NAVIGATION AND SEARCH

## P2-1 Bookmarks

Implement:

- internal bookmarks
- persistent bookmarks where applicable
- navigation
- add
- delete
- rename
- hierarchy

## P2-2 Document properties

Display:

- title
- author
- subject
- keywords
- creator
- producer
- dates
- page count
- size
- PDF version
- encryption
- permissions

## P2-3 Attachments

Display and extract attachments.

Apply security controls.

Never automatically execute an attachment.

## P2-4 Regex search

Add regex search.

Must handle:

- invalid regex
- huge documents
- time limits
- result limits

A problematic regex must not freeze the GUI.

## P2-5 Layers / OCG

Explore PDF layer support.

Must allow:

- detecting layers
- show/hide
- state preservation

---

# P3 — i18n AND PREFERENCES

Convert current translation support into a true internationalization system.

Must allow:

- interface language
- language independent of the PDF language
- preferences
- accessibility
- rendering settings
- cache settings
- behavior settings

All new strings must be translatable.

Never introduce hard-coded GUI strings without going through the i18n system.

---

# P4 — ⭐ ANNOTATIONS

This is a top priority.

PDFAR must become a truly useful PDF reader for study and work. Implement:

## P4-1 Highlight

- select text
- create highlight
- color
- modify
- delete
- PDF persistence

## P4-2 Notes

- note associated with text
- comment
- editing
- deletion
- comments panel

## P4-3 Freehand

- pencil
- color
- thickness
- erase

## P4-4 Shapes

- rectangle
- circle
- line
- arrow
- polygon

## P4-5 Stamps

Support for standard and custom stamps.

## P4-6 Measurement

- distance
- area
- units
- calibration where possible

## P4-7 Annotation panel

Panel displaying:

- page
- type
- author
- date
- content
- color

Clicking an annotation → jump to it.

## P4-8 Undo/Redo

Annotation operations must support undo/redo.

## P4-9 XFDF

Investigate XFDF import/export support.

There must be a clear separation between:

- annotations stored in the PDF
- external annotations
- temporary UI state

VERY IMPORTANT:

Annotations must use the same geometric transformations as selection and search.

Rotating or zooming must not shift an annotation's position.

---

# F5 — FORMS AND SIGNATURES

## F5-1 AcroForms

Support:

- text fields
- checkboxes
- radio buttons
- combo boxes
- buttons

## F5-2 Form filling

Allow entering information without destroying the original document.

## F5-3 Signatures

Before implementing cryptographic signatures, clearly distinguish between:

A) drawing a visual signature

B) inserting an image/visual signature

C) cryptographic digital signature

D) verifying an existing digital signature

Do not confuse these four things. Cryptographic verification must clearly show:

- valid
- invalid
- unknown/unverifiable
- certificate
- issuer
- dates
- chain of trust (when verifiable)

## F5-4 XFA

XFA must be treated as a special feature.

If support is not complete:

DO NOT claim compatibility.

Display a clear warning.

---

# F6 — PAGE MANIPULATION

Implement:

- insert
- delete
- extract
- duplicate
- reorder
- permanently rotate
- split PDF
- merge PDFs

Before modifying a file:

- protect against accidental loss
- prefer "Save As"
- confirm destructive operations
- preserve metadata whenever possible

---

# F7 — ACCESSIBILITY AND SECURITY

## F7-1 Text-to-Speech

Implement text reading.

Must respect:

- reading order
- selection
- pause
- resume
- speed

## F7-2 OCR

Modular architecture.

Do not introduce mandatory heavy OCR if it can be optional.

Ideally:

- detect scanned PDF
- offer OCR
- process pages in the background
- allow cancellation
- preserve original PDF

## F7-3 True redaction

THIS IS CRITICAL.

A black rectangle over text is NOT true redaction.

Redaction must physically remove the underlying content.

There must be proof demonstrating that the redacted text can no longer be:

- selected
- copied
- searched
- extracted

## F7-4 PDF security

Protect against:

- corrupt PDFs
- huge files
- excessive resource usage
- dangerous attachments
- potentially dangerous URLs
- PDF JavaScript
- processing loops

Never execute active content automatically.

---

# F8 — STRETCH FEATURES

These features should only be addressed once the core is stable.

## F8-1 Content editing

Modify existing text or graphic elements.

Do not promise perfect editing for any PDF.

## F8-2 Magnifier

Reading magnifier.

## F8-3 Split view

Two pages/documents simultaneously.

## F8-4 Document comparison

Visual and/or textual comparison between two PDFs. Must distinguish between:

- added text
- deleted text
- modified text
- different pages

---

# F9 — DISTRIBUTION AND QUALITY

## F9-1 ​​CI

Create reproducible CI.

Must execute:

- tests
- lint
- type checking (where feasible)
- build
- smoke tests
- critical benchmarks

## F9-2 Debian package

Complete:

- debian/control
- debian/rules
- changelog
- copyright
- manpage
- icons

The project already includes a Debian-compatible structure and uses the package name `pdfar`. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}

## F9-3 AppImage

Create reproducible AppImage.

## F9-4 Flatpak

Create manifest.

## F9-5 Continuous benchmarks

Each release must be comparable to previous versions.

## F9-6 Privacy

Document:

- what data PDFAR stores
- where it stores it
- whether telemetry exists
- what information remains local

Default:

DO NOT introduce telemetry.

PDFAR must be local-first and privacy-first.

---

# 8. FIRST SPRINT PRIORITY

DO NOT attempt to implement the entire roadmap immediately.

The first sprint must focus exclusively on:

F9-1
CI

P1-1
Tabs

P1-2
Fullscreen / presentation

P2-1
Bookmarks

P4-1
Highlight

P4-2
Notes

Goal:

PDFAR 2.1

The first sprint must be small, verifiable, and stable.

Do not add extra features simply because they seem easy.

---

# 9. AGENT WORK PROTOCOL

For each task:

## Step 1 — Inspect

Inspect related code.

## Step 2 — Baseline

Run tests before modifying. ## Step 3 — Technical plan

Identify:

- files to be modified
- new classes
- new signals
- new tests
- potential risks

## Step 4 — Test first

Create or modify tests before implementation, where reasonable.

## Step 5 — Implement

Make the minimum necessary change.

Do not rewrite entire modules unnecessarily.

## Step 6 — Test

Run:

python3 -m pytest tests/ -v

## Step 7 — Repeat

Run the full suite three consecutive times.

Do not accept:

- crashes
- flaky tests
- inconsistent results

## Step 8 — Visual verification

If it affects the GUI:

tools/screenshot.py

Create visual evidence.

## Step 9 — Performance

Compare against the baseline.

## Step 10 — Review

Check for:

- race conditions
- memory leaks
- live threads
- incorrectly connected signals
- circular references
- unclosed PyMuPDF documents
- QPixmap usage outside the GUI thread
- overlays polluting the cache

## Step 11 — Commit

One logical task = one commit.

The commit message must clearly explain what was implemented.

---

# 10. DO NOT BREAK WHAT ALREADY WORKS

Before modifying:

render.py
viewer.py
cache.py
geometry.py

fully understand how they work.

The current architecture solved significant historical issues:

- render results that never reached the GUI
- incorrect visible ranges
- obsolete geometry after zooming
- unused cache
- search operations that never executed
- problematic lambda connections
- shared PyMuPDF documents
- highlights accumulating in bitmaps
- incorrect cache invalidation

Do not reintroduce any of these issues.

---

# 11. TESTING MATRIX

Each major release must test at least the following:

### PDFs

1. Small PDF
2. 200-page PDF
3. PDF with images
4. PDF with heavy text
5. PDF with multiple columns
6. Rotated PDF
7. Protected PDF
8. PDF without text
9. PDF with bookmarks
10. PDF with annotations
11. PDF with forms
12. Potentially corrupt PDF

### Operations

- open
- close
- change page
- scroll
- zoom
- rotate
- search
- select
- copy
- switch tab
- annotate
- save
- reopen

---

# 12. MEMORY MANAGEMENT

PDFAR must be able to handle large documents.

Never unnecessarily load all pages as giant images. Use:

- lazy rendering
- priority rendering
- limited cache
- eviction
- moderate prefetching

The cache must be limited by memory usage, not simply by the number of pages.

Any new cache must document:

- maximum size
- eviction policy
- ownership
- thread ownership

---

# 13. RESPONSIVENESS

The GUI must never be blocked by:

- rendering
- searching
- OCR
- bulk text extraction
- heavy operations
- document comparison

A heavy operation must:

- execute outside the GUI thread
- display progress when appropriate
- be cancellable when reasonable
- shut down cleanly

---

# 14. SECURITY BY DESIGN

PDFAR processes potentially untrusted documents.

Therefore:

- do not automatically execute PDF JavaScript
- do not automatically open attachments
- do not automatically follow URLs
- do not trust filenames
- validate inputs
- handle exceptions
- limit resource-intensive operations
- prevent crashes caused by malformed documents

A PDF must be considered UNTRUSTED INPUT.

---

# 15. PRODUCT DECISIONS

Do not constantly ask the user for technical details.

Make reasonable technical decisions.

Ask the user only when there is a purely product-related decision that significantly alters behavior.

Examples:

- Should PDFAR digitally sign documents or only verify signatures?
- Should dark mode be automatic (system-based) or user-configurable?
- Should annotations be saved automatically or require a manual "Save" action?

Do not ask about:

- class names
- filenames
- internal structure
- tests
- threading architecture
- cache implementation
- PyMuPDF details

Those decisions are the agent's responsibility, while always adhering to the Golden Rules. ---

# 16. REPORT AFTER EACH TASK

Upon completing each task, report the following:

## Task

Name:

## Status

DONE / BLOCKED / PARTIAL

## Files changed

List of files.

## Tests

Result of:

pytest

and number of runs.

## Visual verification

Indicate whether a screenshot was taken or if not applicable.

## Performance

Baseline:

Current:

Delta:

## Technical debt

List of introduced or existing technical debt.

## Risks

Remaining risks.

## Next recommended task

A single next task.

---

# 17. RELEASE CRITERIA

A version must not be declared stable solely because it compiles.

It must meet the following requirements:

- passing tests
- three consecutive runs
- no known crashes
- no regressions >15%
- updated documentation
- screenshots of key GUI features
- clean shutdown
- workers properly closed
- test PDFs processed correctly
- updated changelog

---

# 18. FUNDAMENTAL PROJECT RULE

Speed ​​must not be achieved by sacrificing stability.

Feature count must not be achieved by sacrificing architecture.

Compatibility must not be achieved by faking capabilities that PDFAR does not actually possess.

The interface must not hide critical errors.

PDFAR must prioritize:

"unsupported, but correctly explained"

over:

"seems to work, but might destroy or alter the document."

---

# 19. ULTIMATE GOAL

The goal is not simply to create:

"another PDF viewer."

The goal is to create:

PDFAR — Advanced PDF Reader for Linux

A reader that is:

- fast
- stable
- professional
- modular
- accessible
- secure
- private
- extensible
- cross-platform within the Linux ecosystem
- comfortable for reading
- powerful for study
- useful for professional work
- compliant with PDF standards
- maintainable for years

Architectural quality is just as important as the number of features.

---

# 20. START NOW

DO NOT implement the entire roadmap.

First:

1. inspect the repository;
2. run the current tests;
3. confirm the baseline;
4. review the actual state of PDFAR 2.0;
5. identify which parts of F9-1, P1-1, P1-2, P2-1, P4-1, and P4-2 already partially exist;
6. do not duplicate existing functionality;
7. propose the exact order for the first sprint;
8. start with the first task;
9. implement;
10. test;
11. verify visually;
12. measure performance;
13. document;
14. make a clean commit.

Do not move on to the next task until the previous one meets the Definition of Done. FIRST SPRINT PRIORITIES:

F9-1 CI
P1-1 Tabs
P1-2 Fullscreen/Presentation
P2-1 Bookmarks
P4-1 Highlight
P4-2 Notes

Target version:

PDFAR 2.1

Following version 2.1, work will continue on the roadmap incrementally.
